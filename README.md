# FuzzyStateMachine

C# implementation for fuzzy state machine

-In FuSM folder there is a class called FuSMController containing fuzzy implementation with AForge and how to use it to
implement a fuzzy state machine.

-In FuSM folder has a shared folder that contains the files for the implementation of a new state and a controller that handles these states.

-In the States folder contains an implementation of a fuzzy state (This update will only be called if you have any pertinence to
that state)

-In StateMachine folder contains the contents presented in unity live training.

-In this example fuzzystatemachine was used to modify some variables of transition states, however I did not have time to do all
implementations.
